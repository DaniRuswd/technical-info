          Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data
          between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using
          short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific and
          medical radio bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz, and building
          personal area networks (PANs). It was originally conceived as a
          wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG),
          which has more than 35,000 member companies in the areas of
          telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.
          The IEEE standardized Bluetooth as IEEE 802.15.1, but no longer
          maintains the standard. The Bluetooth SIG oversees development of the
          specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the
          trademarks. A manufacturer must meet Bluetooth SIG standards to
          market it as a Bluetooth device. A network of patents apply to the
          technology, which are licensed to individual qualifying devices. As of
          2009, Bluetooth integrated circuit chips ship approximately 920
          million units annually.

          The <code>development</code> of the "short-link" <code>radio</code> technology, later named
          Bluetooth, was initiated in 1989 by Nils Rydbeck, CTO at Ericsson
          Mobile in Lund, Sweden. The purpose was to develop <code>wireless</code> headsets,
          according to two inventions by Johan Ullman, SE 8902098-6, issued
          1989-06-12 and SE 9202239, issued 1992-07-24. Nils Rydbeck tasked Tord
          Wingren with specifying and Dutchman Jaap Haartsen and Sven Mattisson
          with developing. Both were working for Ericsson in Lund.In 1990,
          Jaap Haartsen was nominated by the European Patent Office for the
          European Inventor Award.From 1997 Örjan Johansson became the
          project leader and propelled the <code>technology</code> and <code>standardization</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1997, Adalio Sanchez, then head of IBM ThinkPad product R&D,
          approached Nils Rydbeck about collaborating on integrating a mobile
          phone into a ThinkPad notebook. The two assigned engineers from
          Ericsson and IBM to study the idea. The conclusion was that power
          consumption on cellphone technology at that time was too high to allow
          viable integration into a notebook and still achieve adequate battery
          life. Instead, the two companies agreed to integrate Ericsson's
          short-link technology on both a ThinkPad notebook and an Ericsson
          phone to accomplish the goal. Since neither IBM ThinkPad notebooks nor
          Ericsson phones were the market share leaders in their respective
          markets at that time, Adalio Sanchez and Nils Rydbeck agreed to make
          the short-link technology an open industry standard to permit each
          player maximum market access. Ericsson contributed the short-link
          radio technology, and IBM contributed patents around the logical
          layer. Adalio Sanchez of IBM then recruited Stephen Nachtsheim of
          Intel to join and then Intel also recruited Toshiba and Nokia. In May
          1998, the Bluetooth SIG was launched with IBM and Ericsson as the
          founding signatories and a total of five members: Ericsson, Intel,
          Nokia, Toshiba and IBM.

          Bluetooth operates at frequencies between 2.402 and 2.480 GHz, or
          2.400 and 2.4835 GHz including guard bands 2 MHz wide at the bottom
          end and 3.5 MHz wide at the top.This is in the globally
          unlicensed (but not unregulated) industrial, scientific and medical
          (ISM) 2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio
          technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum. Bluetooth divides
          transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79
          designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz.
          It usually performs 1600 hops per second, with adaptive
          frequency-hopping (AFH) enabled.Bluetooth Low Energy uses 2 MHz
          spacing, which accommodates 40 channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluetooth is a packet-based protocol with a master/slave architecture.
          One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a piconet. All
          devices within a given piconet use the clock provided by the master as
          the base for packet exchange. The master clock ticks with a period of
          312.5 μs, two clock ticks then make up a slot of 625 µs, and two slots
          make up a slot pair of 1250 µs. In the simple case of single-slot
          packets, the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots.
          The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd
          slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the
          master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd
          slots.

          Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol
          primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short range based
          on low-cost transceiver microchips in each device. Because the
          devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not
          have to be in visual line of sight of each other; however, a quasi
          optical wireless path must be viable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use Bluetooth wireless technology, a device must be able to
          interpret certain Bluetooth profiles, which are definitions of
          possible applications and specify general behaviors that
          Bluetooth-enabled devices use to communicate with other Bluetooth
          devices. These profiles include settings to parameterize and to
          control the communication from the start. Adherence to profiles saves
          the time for transmitting the parameters anew before the
          bi-directional link becomes effective. There are a wide range of
          Bluetooth profiles that describe many different types of applications
          or use cases for devices.

          Bluetooth exists in numerous products such as telephones, speakers,
          tablets, media players, robotics systems, laptops, and console gaming
          equipment as well as some high definition headsets, modems, hearing
          aids and even watches.Given the variety of devices which use
          the Bluetooth, coupled with the contemporary deprecation of headphone
          jacks by Apple, Google, and other companies, and the lack of
          regulation by the FCC, the technology is prone to interference.
          Nonetheless Bluetooth is useful when transferring information between
          two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth
          situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with
          telephones (i.e., with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with
          hand-held computers (transferring files).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluetooth protocols simplify the discovery and setup of services
          between devices.Bluetooth devices can advertise all of the
          services they provide.This makes using services easier, because
          more of the security, network address and permission configuration can
          be automated than with many other network types.
